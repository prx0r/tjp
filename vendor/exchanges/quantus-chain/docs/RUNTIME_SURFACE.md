# Quantus Runtime Surface

Complete inventory of every piece of code that gets compiled into the on-chain
runtime WASM (`quantus-runtime`). This is the authoritative map of the runtime's
attack/audit surface: the runtime crate's own modules, the pallets composed into
the runtime, their dispatchable calls, the runtime APIs, transaction extensions,
genesis logic, and the workspace primitive crates pulled in.

- **Crate:** `quantus-runtime` (`runtime/`), version `0.7.1-q-day-2`
- **Spec:** `spec_name = quantus-runtime`, `spec_version = 147`, `transaction_version = 6`, `authoring_version = 1`
- **Build:** `no_std` WASM via `substrate-wasm-builder` (`runtime/build.rs`); native `std` build for the node/client
- **Block time target:** 12s (`TARGET_BLOCK_TIME_MS = 12_000`)
- **Consensus:** QPoW (quantum-resistant Proof of Work, Poseidon2-based)
- **Signatures:** Dilithium post-quantum signature schemes (ML-DSA-87 and ML-DSA-65)
- **SS58 prefix:** 189

## 1. Runtime crate source files (`runtime/src/`)

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | Crate root. Core type aliases, `RuntimeVersion`, opaque types, `TxExtension`, `UncheckedExtrinsic`, `Executive`, and the `#[frame_support::runtime]` pallet composition (indices 0–21). |
| `configs/mod.rs` | All `impl pallet::Config for Runtime` blocks, `parameter_types!`, fee model, `HighSecurityConfig`, and `TryFrom<RuntimeCall>` impls. |

| `transaction_extensions.rs` | Custom transaction extensions: `ReversibleTransactionExtension`, `WormholeProofRecorderExtension`. |
| `governance/mod.rs` + `governance/definitions.rs` | Referenda tracks (`CommunityTracksInfo`, `TechCollectiveTracksInfo`), preimage deposit model, custom origins, rank converters. |
| `genesis_config_presets/` | Genesis presets: `dev`, `heisenberg`, `planck`, `mainnet`. Mainnet allocation is `mainnet_vesting.rs`. |

## 2. Pallet composition (`#[frame_support::runtime]`)

The runtime derives `RuntimeCall`, `RuntimeEvent`, `RuntimeError`, `RuntimeOrigin`,
`RuntimeFreezeReason`, `RuntimeHoldReason`, `RuntimeSlashReason`, `RuntimeLockId`, `RuntimeTask`.

## 3. Pallet configuration & dispatchable surface

All `Config` impls live in `runtime/src/configs/mod.rs` unless noted.

### Index 0 — `System` (`frame-system`, local fork)
- Config via `#[derive_impl(SolochainDefaultConfig)]`. `Block = Block`, `Hashing = BlakeTwo256`, `AccountData = pallet_balances::AccountData<Balance>`, `SS58Prefix = 189`, `MaxConsumers = 16`, `BlockHashCount = 4096`.
- `RuntimeBlockWeights`: 6s ref_time, `proof_size = u64::MAX` (uncapped — solo PoW chain).
- `RuntimeBlockLength`: 5 MB, normal dispatch ratio 75%.
- **Local fork additions:** `ZkTreeRoot` storage + `set_zk_tree_root` / `deposit_log` helpers; intra-block entropy.
- **Calls (call_index):** `remark`(0), `set_heap_pages`(1), `set_code`(2), `set_code_without_checks`(3), `set_storage`(4), `kill_storage`(5), `kill_prefix`(6), `remark_with_event`(7), `do_task`(8), `authorize_upgrade`(9), `authorize_upgrade_without_checks`(10), `apply_authorized_upgrade`(11).

### Index 1 — `Timestamp` (`pallet-timestamp`)
- `Moment = u64`, `MinimumPeriod = 100`, `OnTimestampSet = Vesting` (one-shot rebase of the genesis offset schedules onto the first non-zero timestamp in the block-1 inherent; constant-bounded by the genesis table's fixed capacity, `MAX_GENESIS_SCHEDULES` = 64).
- Provides the timestamp inherent.

### Index 2 — `Balances` (`pallet-balances`)
- `Balance = u128`, `ExistentialDeposit = MILLI_UNIT`, `AccountStore = System`, `MaxLocks = 50`, `MaxFreezes = VariantCountOf<RuntimeFreezeReason>`, hold/freeze reasons wired to runtime enums.

### Index 3 — `TransactionPayment` (`pallet-transaction-payment`)
- `OnChargeTransaction = FungibleAdapter<Balances, pallet_mining_rewards::TransactionFeesCollector<Runtime>>` (100% of fees routed to the block miner).
- `WeightToFee = ScaledIdentityFee` (identity mapping × `FEE_SCALE`; 1s compute ≈ `FEE_SCALE` UNIT).
- `LengthToFee = LengthToFeeMultiplier` (custom, `LENGTH_FEE_MULTIPLIER = 10^6` × `FEE_SCALE`; 1 MB ≈ `FEE_SCALE` UNIT).
- `FeeMultiplierUpdate = ConstFeeMultiplier` (multiplier fixed at 1), `OperationalFeeMultiplier = 5`.
- Every absolute-QTC price (fees, deposits, the high-security fee cap) derives from the `FEE_SCALE_NUM/DEN` dial in `runtime/src/lib.rs` via `scale_fee`; percentage rates, the existential deposit, and the leaf quantum are deliberately not scaled.

### Index 5 — `QPoW` (`pallet-qpow`, local)
- `InitialDifficulty = U512([4_000_000, 0, …])`, `TargetBlockTime = 12_000ms`, `MaxReorgDepth = 180`, `WeightInfo = ()`.
- No dispatchable calls. Implements `Hooks` (`on_initialize`/`on_finalize`) to track block timing and recompute difficulty. Powers the `QPoWApi` runtime API.

### Index 6 — `MiningRewards` (`pallet-mining-rewards`, local)
- `Currency = Balances`, `ProofRecorder = Wormhole`, `MaxSupply = 21_000_000 * UNIT`, `EmissionDivisor = 50_000_000`, `MintingAccount`, `Unit = UNIT`. Miner credits are aligned to the ZK-tree leaf quantum (`AMOUNT_SCALE_DOWN_FACTOR` = 10^10).
- No dispatchable calls. Exposes `TransactionFeesCollector` + `collect_transaction_fees`. `on_finalize` requires a miner in the digest, combines transaction fees and the block reward into one miner credit, and rounds it down to the wormhole leaf quantum. A missing miner or a sub-quantum remainder stays in `CollectedFees` for the next miner — nothing is minted to treasury.

### Index 7 — `Preimage` (`pallet-preimage`)
- `ManagerOrigin = EnsureRoot`, `Consideration = PreimageDeposit` (custom: 0.1 UNIT base + 0.0001 UNIT/byte, × `FEE_SCALE`, see `governance/definitions.rs`).
- **Calls:** `note_preimage`, `unnote_preimage`, `request_preimage`, `unrequest_preimage`, `ensure_updated` (upstream).

### Index 8 — `Scheduler` (`pallet-scheduler`, local) — **calls disabled**
- `RuntimeCall`, `MaximumWeight = 80% max block`, `MaxScheduledPerBlock = 50`, `ScheduleOrigin = EnsureRoot`, `Preimages = Preimage`, `TimeProvider = Timestamp`, `Moment = u64`, `TimestampBucketSize = 2 * block time`.
- Calls exist (`schedule`(0), `cancel`(1), `schedule_named`(2), `cancel_named`(3), `schedule_after`(4), `schedule_named_after`(5), `set_retry`(6), `set_retry_named`(7), `cancel_retry`(8), `cancel_retry_named`(9)) but are **disabled at the runtime level** so users cannot enqueue arbitrary calls. Used internally by reversible-transfers and governance via the `ScheduleNamed` trait. Local fork adds block-number-or-timestamp scheduling.
- **Priority-reserved headroom:** tasks scheduled at `LOWEST_PRIORITY` (the permissionless scheduling surface — reversible transfers) may occupy at most ~80% of a block's agenda (40 of 50 slots). This reserves ~20% per block — at least one slot even if `MaxScheduledPerBlock < 5` — so a permissionless caller cannot cheaply pre-fill a referendum's deterministic enactment block with priority-255 tasks. Mid-priority tasks (e.g. referendum alarms at 128) can still occupy reserved slots, but `schedule_enactment` retries at `when + 1` for up to 16 blocks on `Exhausted` before logging failure.

### Index 9 — `Utility` (`pallet-utility`)
- `RuntimeCall`, `PalletsOrigin = OriginCaller`.
- **Calls:** `batch_all` only (`call_index` 2). Other FRAME utility combinators (`batch`, `as_derivative`, `dispatch_as`, `force_batch`, `with_weight`, `if_else`, `dispatch_as_fallible`) are omitted.

### Index 10 — `Referenda` (`pallet-referenda`, community instance)
- `Tracks = CommunityTracksInfo` (single "signed" track), `Tally = pallet_conviction_voting::Tally<Balance, DynamicMaxTurnout>`, `SubmitOrigin = EnsureSigned`, `Cancel/KillOrigin = EnsureRoot`, `SubmissionDeposit = 100 UNIT`, `UndecidingTimeout = 45 DAYS`, `Preimages = Preimage`.
- **Calls:** `submit`, `place_decision_deposit`, `refund_decision_deposit`, `cancel`, `kill`, `nudge_referendum`, `one_fewer_deciding`, `refund_submission_deposit`, `set_metadata`.

### Index 11 — `ReversibleTransfers` (`pallet-reversible-transfers`, local)
- `AssetId = u32` (retained for wire-format compatibility; asset transfers are rejected), `Scheduler = Scheduler`, `DefaultDelay = 1 DAY`, `MinDelayPeriodBlocks = 2`, `MaxPendingPerAccount = 16`, `VolumeFee = 1%` (high-security reversals, burned), `ProofRecorder = Wormhole`, `PalletId = "rtpallet"`.
- **Calls:** `set_high_security`(0), `cancel`(1), `execute_transfer`(2), `schedule_transfer`(3), `schedule_transfer_with_delay`(4), `recover_funds`(7). Call indices 5/6 were `schedule_asset_transfer` / `schedule_asset_transfer_with_delay` (removed with assets); kept vacant so `recover_funds` stays at 7. Pending transfers with `Some(asset_id)` fail with `AssetsNotSupported`.
- There is deliberately no on-chain guardian → protected-accounts index (a bounded one could be filled by strangers to grief a popular guardian; enrollment needs no guardian consent since guardianship grants only passive powers). Guardianship is authoritative in `HighSecurityAccounts`; offchain indexers (Subsquid) reconstruct the reverse mapping from `HighSecuritySet` events.
- The guardian holds instant, total seizure power (`recover_funds` sweeps all holds plus the whole free balance to it, no delay, no second approver, immutable relationship), so the recommended guardian is a **multisig address**: `pallet_multisig` dispatches as its derived address, and the cancel/recover lifecycle under a multisig guardian is pinned by an integration test.
- Backs `HighSecurityConfig` (account whitelist/guardian logic).

### Index 12 — `ConvictionVoting` (`pallet-conviction-voting`)
- `Currency = Balances`, `Polls = Referenda`, `MaxTurnout = DynamicMaxTurnout` (scales with total issuance), `VoteLockingPeriod = 7 DAYS`, `MaxVotes = 4096`.
- **Calls:** `vote`, `delegate`, `undelegate`, `unlock`, `remove_vote`, `remove_other_vote`.

### Index 13 — `TechCollective` (`pallet-ranked-collective`)
- `AddOrigin = EnsureRootWithSuccess<AccountId, ConstU16<0>>` (Root-only, i.e. a passed TechReferenda vote; #91267), `RemoveOrigin = EnsureRootRemoveKeepsMemberFloor` (Root-only **and** refuses removals that would leave fewer than `MIN_TECH_COLLECTIVE_MEMBERS` members — the floor that keeps the tech-referenda lane live), `Promote/Demote/ExchangeOrigin = NeverEnsureOrigin`, `Polls = TechReferenda (Instance1)`, `VoteWeight = Linear`, `MaxMemberCount = 13` (via `GlobalMaxMembers`).
- **Calls:** `add_member`, `promote_member`, `demote_member`, `remove_member`, `vote`, `cleanup_poll`, `exchange_member`. Removal intentionally leaves the member's votes in ongoing tallies (upstream behavior); `support` clamps at 100% so the shrunken electorate cannot overflow the curve.

### Index 14 — `TechReferenda` (`pallet-referenda`, `Instance1`)
- `SubmitOrigin = RootOrMemberForTechReferendaOrigin`, `Tracks = TechCollectiveTracksInfo` (track 0 for Root proposals, 61% approval / 60% support constant curves; track 1 `fast_upgrade` for `FastUpgrade` proposals, 80%/80% constant curves with 10-minute prepare/confirm/enactment), `Tally = pallet_ranked_collective::TallyOf<Runtime>`, `MaxActive = 128` / `MaxActivePerAccount = 8` (global + per-submitter caps on `Ongoing` referenda; storage `ActiveReferendaCount` / `ActiveSubmissionCount`; errors `TooManyActive` / `TooManyActiveBySubmitter`), `MaxProposalSize = 4 KiB`.
- **Calls:** same set as `Referenda` (separate instance/storage).

### Index 15 — `TreasuryPallet` (`pallet-treasury`, local)
- Minimal local treasury. Config only sets `WeightInfo`.
- **Calls:** `set_treasury_account`(0, root). Exposes `account_id()`. Treasury is not paid from mining rewards.

### Index 19 — `Multisig` (`pallet-multisig`, local)
- `MaxSigners = 100`, `MaxTotalProposalsInStorage = 200`, `MaxCallSize = 10 KB`, `MultisigFee = 0.03 × FEE_SCALE UNIT` (burned), `ProposalDeposit = 0.01 × FEE_SCALE UNIT`, `ProposalFee = 0.05 × FEE_SCALE UNIT`, `MaxExpiryDuration ≈ 2 weeks`, `MaxInnerCallWeight = (10^12, 2.5 MB)`, `HighSecurity = HighSecurityConfig`, `PalletId = "py/mltsg"`.
- **Calls:** `create_multisig`(0), `propose`(1), `approve`(2), `cancel`(3), `remove_expired`(4), `claim_deposits`(5), `execute`(6). Exposes `derive_multisig_address`.

### Index 20 — `Wormhole` (`pallet-wormhole`, local)
- `Currency = Balances`, `AssetId = u32` (native leaves tagged as asset id 0 internally; non-native exits unsupported), `VolumeFeeRateBps = 4` (0.04%; settlement ceil-rounds to ≥0.01 QTC per accepted private segment and sums those fees across a public batch), `VolumeFeesBurnRate = 50%`, `MintingAccount`, `WormholeAccountId = AccountId32`, `ZkTree = ZkTree`. No separate minimum exit amount. No `pallet-assets` dependency.
- **Calls:** `verify_private_batch`(2) — verifies a private-batch ZK proof and processes batched transfers; `verify_public_batch`(3) — verifies a public-batch proof with per-segment denial and aggregator fee rebate.
- Implements `TransferProofRecorder` (`record_transfer`) consumed by mining-rewards, reversible-transfers, and the wormhole tx-extension. `on_initialize` emits genesis endowment proofs at block 1. Loads a static aggregated verifier (`get_aggregated_verifier`).

### Index 21 — `ZkTree` (`pallet-zk-tree`, local)
- `AssetId = u32`, `Balance = u128`. No dispatchable calls.
- **Storage:** `Leaves`, `Nodes`, `LeafCount`, `Depth`, `Root`. Types `ZkLeaf`, `ZkMerkleProof`, `ZkMerkleProofRpc`, `Hash256`.
- `on_finalize` commits the merkle root. Backs the `ZkTreeApi` runtime API.

### Index 22 — `Vesting` (`pallet-vesting`, local)
- Pull-based "vesting wallet": the pallet's sovereign pot (`PalletId(*b"qvesting")`, keyless) holds the entire unclaimed allocation; beneficiaries are paid by plain keep-alive transfers only when a payout is due. **No locks, freezes, or holds ever touch a beneficiary account**, so wormhole addresses can be beneficiaries.
- Config: `Currency = Balances` (`fungible::{Inspect, Mutate}`), `TimeProvider = Timestamp` (ms since epoch), `AdminOrigin = EitherOfDiverse<EnsureRoot, EnsureTreasury>` (`EnsureTreasury` = signed by the configured treasury account; the treasury multisig executes proposals as a plain signed origin), `TreasuryAccount = TreasuryAccountOption` (Option-returning storage read, never panics), `ProofRecorder = Wormhole`, `PayoutQuantum = SCALE_DOWN_FACTOR` (10^10 = 0.01 QTC), `MinClaimInterval = 86,400,000 ms` (24 hours). Non-final claims are further aligned to `pallet_vesting::NON_FINAL_PAYOUT_QUANTA` (2,500) leaf quanta = 25 QTC, the smallest 4 bps fee-exact multiple. Timestamp `OnTimestampSet = Vesting`: when genesis used `anchor_to_first_timestamp`, the first non-zero timestamp (block 1 inherent, not genesis-block `Now` which is 0) is stored in `Launch` and added onto those genesis offsets. The genesis table is a `BoundedVec` of at most `MAX_GENESIS_SCHEDULES` (64) entries, so that one-time rebase is constant-bounded.
- **Storage:** `Schedules: schedule_id (u64) → { beneficiary, start, cliff, end, total, claimed, last_claim_at }` (ids sequential, never reused; a beneficiary may hold any number of schedules), `NextScheduleId`, `Launch` (absent on absolute-time chains; `Pending` → `Anchored(moment)` once offset genesis schedules are rebased). Storage version 0 has no migration: an in-place upgrade with no schedules may leave the pot unfunded, and `create_schedule` then fails with `PotUnderfunded` until the treasury sends it one ED.
- Vesting math: `vested(t) = 0` before `cliff`, `total` from `end`, else `⌊total·(t−start)/(end−start)⌋` (256-bit rational, floor; the `end` branch guarantees exactness).
- **Payout policy:** wormhole leaves commit `amount / 10^10`, so a sub-quantum payout would create a zero-value leaf and strand funds on a keyless beneficiary. Schedule totals must be a positive multiple of `PayoutQuantum`; payouts are quantized and `claimed` stays aligned. A successful claim must pay at least one quantum and be at least 24 hours after that schedule's previous payout. Non-final claims additionally round down to 25 QTC (`NON_FINAL_PAYOUT_QUANTA` leaf quanta) so each intermediate leaf has an exact 4 bps Wormhole fee; leftover dust stays on the schedule. The final claim pays the exact remainder (at least one quantum). `end_schedule` pays the unpaid vested part rounded to the nearest `PayoutQuantum` to the beneficiary when that amount is at least one quantum; otherwise the sliver is refunded with every leftover planck to treasury. Both legs are recorded as leaves.
- **Proof recording:** the pallet records every transfer via `TransferProofRecorder` itself (`transfer_and_record` fuses transfer + record and fails with `TransferProofNotRecorded` if the recorder drops the credit, rolling the transfer back) — pot → beneficiary claims, treasury → pot funding, and pot → treasury refunds — so scheduler-enacted Root calls — invisible to the event-scanning extension — still create leaves; the extension skips pot-touching transfer events and charges no static weight for vesting calls; `pallet_vesting::weights` prices each recorded leaf (one for `claim` and `create_schedule`, two for `end_schedule`) at the flat marginal ZK-tree insert cost on top of the benchmarked base.
- **Calls:** `claim`(0) — **permissionless**; pays the largest valid claim from the pot to the schedule's stored beneficiary (never the caller); the only claim path for keyless/high-security beneficiaries. `create_schedule`(1) — admin; validates the schedule and funds the pot from the treasury in the same call. `end_schedule`(2) — admin; unpaid vested part rounded to the nearest quantum → beneficiary if it is at least one quantum, otherwise the whole remainder → treasury; schedule removed. `retarget_schedule`(3) — admin; changes the beneficiary and pays nothing out. A retarget replaces the *same* grantee's lost/stolen/abandoned wallet, so settling the old address would burn funds or pay a thief; everything vested but unclaimed stays on the schedule and reaches the new wallet at its next claim. (A permissionless claim landing before the retarget still pays the old address, so rotations should happen promptly.)
- Genesis build validates every schedule (`start ≤ cliff ≤ end`, `start < end`, `total` a positive multiple of `PayoutQuantum`, beneficiary ≠ pot) and, for a non-empty table, asserts the pot holds exactly `Σ schedule totals + ED`; a misconfigured chain refuses to start. `try_state` validates stored schedules, aligned claims, remaining obligations of zero or at least one quantum, and—when any schedule exists—`pot balance ≥ Σ(total − claimed) + ED`; an empty schedule table is valid with an unfunded pot.

### Index 23 — `Origins` (`pallet_custom_origins`, local)
- Storage-less, call-less, event-less origin declaration: its whole body is one `#[pallet::origin] enum Origin { FastUpgrade }`. A pallet is the only way to contribute a variant to `RuntimeOrigin`/`OriginCaller`.
- `Origin::FastUpgrade` is the proposal origin of tech-referenda track 1 (`fast_upgrade`) and is honored **only** by `system.authorize_upgrade` (`AuthorizeUpgradeOrigin = EitherOfDiverse<EnsureRoot, FastUpgrade>` in the forked frame-system). `set_code` and `authorize_upgrade_without_checks` remain Root-only, so the track can publish an upgrade hash and nothing else.
- **Calls:** none. See `docs/RUNTIME_UPGRADE_VIA_GOVERNANCE.md` for the authorize-then-apply flow.

## 5. Transaction extensions (`TxExtension` in `lib.rs`)

Signed-extension pipeline applied to every extrinsic, in order:

1. `frame_system::CheckNonZeroSender`
2. `frame_system::CheckSpecVersion`
3. `frame_system::CheckTxVersion`
4. `frame_system::CheckGenesis`
5. `frame_system::CheckEra`
6. `frame_system::CheckNonce`
7. `frame_system::CheckWeight`
8. `transaction_extensions::ReversibleTransactionExtension` — **custom**: blocks non-whitelisted calls from high-security accounts, and rejects a high-security signer that has already included 16 extrinsics in the rolling 24h window (`HighSecurityTxQuota`: ring of 16 block numbers, O(1) update).
9. `transaction_extensions::WormholeProofRecorderExtension` — **custom**: in `post_dispatch`, scans emitted native `Balances::Transfer` / `Balances::Minted` / `Balances::TransferOnHold` / `Balances::ReserveRepatriated` events and records transfer proofs into the ZK tree (event-based, covers direct/batch/multisig native transfers). Statically pre-charged calls (`count_transfers`): `Balances` transfers, `Utility::batch_all`, `ReversibleTransfers::{cancel, recover_funds}`, and `Multisig::execute` (recurses into the resubmitted inner call); uncounted paths are reconciled via `register_extra_weight_unchecked`. Transfers touching the **vesting pot** are skipped: the vesting pallet records its own payouts (covering scheduler-enacted Root calls the extension never sees) and carries that cost in its benchmarked weights. A statically-counted transfer *into* the pot is charged for a leaf insert the scan then skips — an accepted overcharge on a rare bootstrap operation. Per-transfer recording weight is flat, priced at the circuit depth ceiling (`pallet_zk_tree::INSERT_LEAF_*` constants: DB ops, Poseidon path hashing, and per-key PoV). Statically over-charged reservations (failed transfers, short batches, `recover_funds` below the worst case) are returned in `post_dispatch_details`; the extension sits **before** `ChargeTransactionPayment` so the refund reaches the payer's fee, and the trailing `WeightReclaim` returns it to block capacity.
10. `pallet_transaction_payment::ChargeTransactionPayment` — **stock**. The high-security zero-tip policy is not on this extension: it is enforced by `transaction_extensions::HighSecurityFungibleAdapter`, the configured `OnChargeTransaction`, which sees both the signer and the tip on every fee path (`can_withdraw_fee` during mempool and consensus validation, `withdraw_fee` at inclusion) and rejects any non-zero tip from a high-security signer — so no refactor of the extension tuple can silently reopen the tip channel.
11. `frame_metadata_hash_extension::CheckMetadataHash`
12. `frame_system::WeightReclaim` — re-runs the block-weight reclaim so refunds made by earlier extensions (which `CheckWeight`'s own reclaim runs too early to see) are returned to block capacity.

The high-security whitelist (`HighSecurityConfig::is_whitelisted`, extension 8) admits `ReversibleTransfers::{schedule_transfer, cancel, recover_funds}` and a flat `Utility::batch_all` of 1..=`MaxHighSecurityBatchLen` (16, deliberately decoupled from `MaxPendingPerAccount`) of those leaf calls. Nested or empty batches are rejected so a packed wrapper cannot inflate the inclusion fee. `schedule_transfer` is admitted only when `dest` is `MultiAddress::Id` — other `MultiAddress` variants (in particular unbounded `Raw`) are rejected so a stolen key cannot inflate the length fee. `Vesting::claim` is permissionless (any signer, payout always to the stored beneficiary), so a high-security account does not need it on the list. Beyond the shape rules, extension 8 enforces two blanket bounds on every high-security extrinsic: at most `MAX_HIGH_SECURITY_EXTRINSIC_LEN` (10 KiB) encoded bytes, and a zero-tip inclusion fee of at most `MAX_HIGH_SECURITY_INCLUSION_FEE` (`FEE_SCALE` UNIT — scaled in lockstep with the fees it bounds, ~10x the costliest legitimate call) — so a future whitelisted call with an unforeseen length or weight surface cannot reopen the fee-drain channel. Combined with the 16-per-day quota, the worst-case drain from a stolen key is 16 × `FEE_SCALE` UNIT per rolling day. The quota keys on the outer signer, so a single-key high-security guardian shares it with its own traffic and can be locked out of `cancel`/`recover_funds` for up to a day — a documented limitation; the recommended multisig guardian is immune because the derived address never signs extrinsics (its signers do), even when the multisig itself is enrolled as high-security.

## 6. Governance definitions (`governance/definitions.rs`)

- `PreimageDeposit` — custom `Consideration` fee model for preimages.
- `CommunityTracksInfo` — public referenda; single "signed" track (max_deciding 5, 500 UNIT decision deposit, 7-day decision, linear-decreasing approval 70→55% / support 25→5%).
- `TechCollectiveTracksInfo` — tech-collective referenda; track 0 for Root proposals (10 × `FEE_SCALE` UNIT deposit, 61% approval / 60% support constant curves, 1-day decision/confirm/enactment) and track 1 `fast_upgrade` for `FastUpgrade` proposals (10 × `FEE_SCALE` UNIT deposit, 80%/80% constant curves = 8-of-10 at genesis, 10-minute prepare/confirm/enactment — the runtime-upgrade lane, see `docs/RUNTIME_UPGRADE_VIA_GOVERNANCE.md`).
- `MinRankOfClassConverter`, `GlobalMaxMembers` — rank/membership converters.
- `RootOrMemberForTechReferendaOrigin` — custom origin for TechReferenda submission (Root or ranked-collective member).
- `governance/origins.rs` (`pallet_custom_origins`, runtime index 23 as `Origins`) — storage-less origin declarations; `Origin::FastUpgrade` is dispatched by approved fast-track referenda and honored only by `system.authorize_upgrade` (`AuthorizeUpgradeOrigin = Root or FastUpgrade` in the forked frame-system).
- `apply_test_timing` — compiled only under `fast-governance` (collapses all timing windows to 2 blocks for CI).

## 7. Genesis presets (`genesis_config_presets/`)

- **Presets:** `dev` (`DEV_RUNTIME_PRESET`), `heisenberg`, `planck`, `mainnet` (`MAINNET_RUNTIME_PRESET`, gated on `mainnet_vesting::FINALIZED`).
- **Network roles:**
  - `dev` — local development.
  - `heisenberg` — **internal integration testnet**, not mainnet. Tokens have no monetary value; the network may be reset.
  - `planck` — public testnet (live treasury signers + faucet).
  - `mainnet` — production genesis. Allocation is `runtime/src/genesis_config_presets/mainnet_vesting.rs`: 27% of `MAX_SUPPLY` (5_670_000) at TGE, every coin in one of two places. `VESTING` is a 48-row table of `(account, amount, start day, end day)`: 45 grants locked until day 365 then linear to day 1460, one 42_000 grant linear from day 0 to 365, 210_000 treasury liquidity linear from day 0 to 16, and 502_438 company vesting to the treasury on the grant clock. `SEED` (3 QTC) is endowed as free balance to each of the 10 `TREASURERS` and 10 `TECH_COLLECTIVE` members so they can act from block 1; the two lists are distinct. `sum(VESTING) + 20 × SEED == GENESIS_ALLOCATION` is a compile-time assertion; the pot's ED is the only issuance outside it. The treasury is the 6-of-10 multisig derived from `TREASURERS`. Vesting clocks are offsets from the first non-zero timestamp. The preset panics until `FINALIZED` is flipped.
- **Vesting genesis:** every preset endows the vesting pot with `Σ schedule totals + ED` (ED alone when the table is empty, as on `planck`). Because the pot is part of the balances genesis endowment, standard genesis proof generation creates a block-1 Wormhole leaf for it; that leaf is unspendable because the pot is keyless. `dev`/`heisenberg` seed example schedules (one account with two schedules; `dev` also vests the keyless test wormhole address, claimable only via third-party ping). `mainnet` uses the `VESTING` table in `mainnet_vesting.rs` (address, amount, start day, end day; no personal names). Times are offsets from the first non-zero timestamp (`anchor_to_first_timestamp`); the genesis block timestamp is 0 and is not used. Every row has `start == cliff`, so nothing unlocks as a lump.
- Dilithium well-known accounts: `crystal_alice`, `dilithium_bob`, `crystal_charlie` (public seeds `[0]` / `[1]` / `[2]`). Used by `dev` and **intentionally also by `heisenberg`** so integrators and CI can exercise governance, treasury, and transfer flows without distributing secrets. Those private keys are public by design; do **not** reuse this pattern on a mainnet or any value-bearing chain (Planck already uses distinct live treasury signers).
- Treasury = 2-of-3 multisig of the three signers for `dev`/`heisenberg`, 6-of-10 of `TREASURERS` for `mainnet`; no liquid treasury genesis balance (the mainnet treasury receives its share through vesting rows).
- Tech-collective seeded via the chain-spec-only `tech_collective_seed_members` JSON field (`prepare_genesis_build_input` + `seed_tech_collective`).
- Endows all genesis balances with wormhole transfer proofs (ZK-spendable). `dev` also endows `TEST_WORMHOLE_SECRET`'s address.

## 10. Cargo features affecting the compiled runtime (`runtime/Cargo.toml`)

| Feature | Effect on compiled runtime |
| --- | --- |
| `default = ["std"]` | Native build; enables `std` across all deps + `substrate-wasm-builder`. WASM build is `no_std`. |
| `runtime-benchmarks` | Compiles `benchmarks.rs`, benchmark `Config` impls, and `Benchmark` API; adds benchmark-only genesis (reversible-transfers HS account). |
| `try-runtime` | Compiles `TryRuntime` API and migration checks. |
| `metadata-hash` | Enables `CheckMetadataHash` metadata generation (double WASM compile). |
| `fast-governance` | **Test/CI only.** Collapses every referenda timing window to 2 blocks (`apply_test_timing`). Must be OFF for production. |
| `on-chain-release-build` | `metadata-hash` + `sp-api/disable-logging` for release WASM. |

## 11. Lifecycle hooks (per-block execution surface)

| Pallet | Hooks implemented |
| --- | --- |
| `frame-system` (local) | `integrity_test` |
| `QPoW` | `on_initialize`, `on_finalize` (difficulty + block timing) |
| `MiningRewards` | `integrity_test`, `on_initialize`, `on_finalize` (block reward mint + fee distribution) |
| `Wormhole` | `on_initialize` (genesis proof emission at block 1) |
| `Scheduler` (local) | `on_initialize` (executes due agenda items) |
| `ZkTree` | `on_finalize` (commit merkle root) |
| `ReversibleTransfers` | `integrity_test` |

Plus the upstream pallets' own hooks, all driven through
`Executive` over `AllPalletsWithSystem`.

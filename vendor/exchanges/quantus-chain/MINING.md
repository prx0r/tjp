## Important: Wormhole Address System

**⚠️ Mining rewards are automatically sent to wormhole addresses derived from your preimage.**

- You provide a 32-byte preimage when starting mining
- The system derives your wormhole address using Poseidon hashing
- All mining rewards are sent to this derived wormhole address
- This ensures all miners use privacy-preserving wormhole addresses

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2+ cores
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Storage**: 100GB available space
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (3+ Mbps)
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS (10.15+), or Windows 10/11 (native MSVC build or WSL2)

> ⚠️ Connections below 3 Mbps will likely fail to keep the node synced with the network.

### Recommended Requirements
- **CPU**: 4+ cores (higher core count improves mining performance - coming soon)
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD
- **Network**: Broadband connection (10+ Mbps)

## Setup

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or the script doesn't work for your system:

1. **Download Binary**

   Get the latest binary [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/releases/latest)

2. **Generate Node Identity**
   ```bash
   ./quantus-node key generate-node-key --file ~/.quantus/node_key.p2p
   ```

3. **Generate Wormhole Address & Preimage**
   
   ```bash
   ./quantus-node key quantus --scheme wormhole
   ```
   
   This generates a wormhole key pair and shows:
   - `Address`: Your wormhole address (where rewards will be sent)
   - `inner_hash`: Your 32-byte preimage (use this for mining)
   
   **Save the preimage** - you'll need it for the `--rewards-address` parameter.

4. **Run the node (Planck network)**

Minimal command - see --help for many more options
```sh
./quantus-node \
    --validator \
    --chain planck \
    --node-key-file ~/.quantus/node_key.p2p \
    --rewards-inner-hash <YOUR_PREIMAGE_FROM_STEP_3> \
    --max-blocks-per-request 64 \
    --sync full
```

**Note:** Use the `inner_hash` from step 3 as your `--rewards-inner-hash`. The node will derive your wormhole address and log it on startup.

**Note on the authoring freshness gate:** a validator refuses to mine until it has seen its best block be at most `--max-tip-age` seconds old (default 24 hours), so a node that is still syncing does not waste work on stale tips. Genesis has no block timestamp and therefore remains gated. To bootstrap a brand-new network, start the intended bootstrap validator with `--force-authoring`; once block 1 exists and peers are connected, restart it without that flag. Never use this override merely to join an established network. It is also the manual recovery option if the entire network has been stalled longer than the tip-age limit.

### Windows Setup

The native Windows MSVC build (`quantus-node-*-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`) works on Windows 10/11, but requires two pieces of one-time setup before a full sync will complete.

#### 1. Exclude the base-path from Windows Defender

Real-time scanning on the RocksDB directory will block block-import IO and cause silent sync stalls (healthy peers, active network download, zero block progression).

In an **elevated PowerShell** (Run as administrator):

```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:USERPROFILE\.quantus"
```

Adjust the path if you pass a custom `--base-path`. The exclusion only needs to be added once per machine.

#### 2. Recommended sync flags

```
--sync full --max-blocks-per-request 64
```

These flags are recommended for all platforms but are especially important on Windows, where they reduce the blast radius of any residual IO hiccups during block-import.

#### Alternative: WSL2

If you cannot add a Defender exclusion (e.g. managed device, no admin rights), running the Linux build under WSL2 is also supported: follow the Manual Installation instructions above from inside your WSL2 shell.

### Docker Installation

For users who prefer containerized deployment or have only Docker installed:

#### Quick Start with Docker

Follow these steps to get your Docker-based validator node running:

**Step 1: Prepare a Local Directory for Node Data**

Create a dedicated directory on your host machine to store persistent node data, such as your P2P key and rewards address file.
```bash
mkdir -p ./quantus_node_data
```
This command creates a directory named `quantus_node_data` in your current working directory.

**Optional Linux**
On linux you may need to make sure this directory has generous permissions so Docker can access it

```bash
chmod 755 quantus_node_data
```

**Step 2: Generate Your Node Identity (P2P Key)**

Your node needs a unique P2P identity to connect to the network. Generate this key into your data directory:
```bash
# If on Apple Silicon, you may need to add --platform linux/amd64
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v "$(pwd)/quantus_node_data":/var/lib/quantus_data_in_container \
  ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest \
  key generate-node-key --file /var/lib/quantus_data_in_container/node_key.p2p
```
Replace `quantus-node:v0.0.4` with your desired image (e.g., `ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest`).
This command saves `node_key.p2p` into your local `./quantus_node_data` directory.

**Step 3: Generate Your Wormhole Address**

```bash
# If on Apple Silicon, you may need to add --platform linux/amd64
docker run --rm ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest key quantus --scheme wormhole
```

This generates a wormhole key pair. Save the `inner_hash` value - this is your preimage for mining.

**Step 4: Run the Validator Node**

```bash
# If on Apple Silicon, you may need to add --platform linux/amd64
# Replace YOUR_PREIMAGE with the inner_hash from step 3
docker run -d \
  --name quantus-node \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v "$(pwd)/quantus_node_data":/var/lib/quantus \
  -p 30333:30333 \
  -p 9944:9944 \
  ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest \
  --validator \
  --base-path /var/lib/quantus \
  --chain planck \
  --node-key-file /var/lib/quantus/node_key.p2p \
  --rewards-inner-hash <YOUR_PREIMAGE>
```

*Note for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) users:* As mentioned above, if you are using an `amd64` based Docker image on an ARM-based Mac, you will likely need to add the `--platform linux/amd64` flag to your `docker run` commands.

Your node should now be starting up! You can check its logs using `docker logs -f quantus-node`.

#### Docker Management Commands

**View logs**
```bash
docker logs -f quantus-node
```

**Stop node**
```bash
docker stop quantus-node
```

**Start node again**
```bash
docker start quantus-node
```

**Remove container**
```bash
docker stop quantus-node && docker rm quantus-node
```

#### Updating Your Docker Node

When a new version is released:

```bash
# Stop and remove current container
docker stop quantus-node && docker rm quantus-node

# Pull latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest

# Start new container (data is preserved in ~/.quantus)
./run-node.sh --mode validator --rewards YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE
```

#### Docker-Specific Configuration

**Custom data directory**
```bash
./run-node.sh --data-dir /path/to/custom/data --name "my-node"
```

**Specific version**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quantus-node \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 30333:30333 \
  -p 9944:9944 \
  -v ~/.quantus:/var/lib/quantus \
  ghcr.io/quantus-network/quantus-node:latest \
  --validator \
  --base-path /var/lib/quantus \
  --chain planck \
  --rewards-address YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE
```

**Docker system requirements**
- Docker 20.10+ or compatible runtime
- All other system requirements same as binary installation

## External Miner Setup

For high-performance mining, you can offload the mining process to a separate service, freeing up node resources.

### Prerequisites

1. **Download Node Binary:**

   Get the latest `quantus-node` binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/releases/latest).

2. **Download External Miner Binary:**

   Get the latest `quantus-miner` binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/quantus-miner/releases/latest).

### Setup with Wormhole Addresses

1. **Generate Your Wormhole Address**:
   ```bash
   ./quantus-node key quantus --scheme wormhole
   ```
   Save the `inner_hash` value.

2. **Start the Node** (QUIC server for miners):
   ```bash
   # Replace <YOUR_PREIMAGE> with the inner_hash from step 1
   RUST_LOG=info,sc_consensus_pow=debug ./quantus-node \
    --validator \
    --chain planck \
    --miner-listen-port 9833 \
    --rewards-inner-hash <YOUR_PREIMAGE>
   ```
   The node binds a QUIC server on `0.0.0.0:9833` and waits for miners to connect. When `--miner-listen-port` is set, local mining is disabled. On first start it writes a shared auth token (`miner-auth-token`, not logged — read the file) and a TLS cert fingerprint (`miner-tls-cert-sha256`, logged) under `<base-path>/chains/<chain>/`. If miner-server startup fails (bad token file, TLS material, bind error), the node exits instead of falling back to local mining. ⚠️ Keep this port off the public internet — see [Do NOT expose the miner port to the public internet](#️-do-not-expose-the-miner-port-to-the-public-internet).

3. **Start External Miner** (in separate terminal, connects to the node):
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info ./quantus-miner serve \
     --node-addr 127.0.0.1:9833 \
     --auth-token-file <BASE_PATH>/chains/<CHAIN>/miner-auth-token \
     --tls-cert-sha256-file <BASE_PATH>/chains/<CHAIN>/miner-tls-cert-sha256
   ```
   Useful flags: `--cpu-workers <N>`, `--gpu-devices <N>`, `--metrics-port <PORT>` (default `9900`). If the node is on another host, replace `127.0.0.1` with its IP.

For developers building custom miner implementations, see the [External Miner Protocol Specification](#external-miner-protocol-specification) section below.

### ⚠️ Do NOT expose the miner port to the public internet

The miner port (`--miner-listen-port`, e.g. `9833/UDP`) is a **private control
channel between your node and your own miners**. It is **not** a public network
service and must never be reachable from the open internet.

- **Shared-secret auth + TLS cert pinning.** Miners must present the node's auth
  token in the initial `Ready` message, and must pin the node's TLS certificate
  SHA-256. Defaults under `<base-path>/chains/<chain>/`:
  `miner-auth-token`, `miner-tls-cert.der` / `miner-tls-key.der`, and
  `miner-tls-cert-sha256`. Auth token path can be overridden with
  `--miner-auth-token-file`. There is still no IP allow-list or client
  certificate check — keep the port private.
- **It always binds to `0.0.0.0:<port>`.** The node listens on all interfaces;
  there is no flag to bind it to loopback only. Reachability is therefore
  controlled entirely by your firewall / port publishing, not by the node.
- **What an attacker on that port can do without the token:** open connections /
  streams and attempt to guess the token (failed auths are rejected before the
  peer is registered as a miner). **With the token** (or if the port is exposed
  and the token leaks via logs/files): flood the node with bogus job results,
  observe mining activity (job hashes and difficulty), and contribute to
  resource exhaustion. Keep the port private regardless.

**How to keep it private:**

- **Local miners (same host):** point the miner at `127.0.0.1:9833` and do
  **not** open the port on any external firewall. Nothing else is required.
- **Remote miners (another host you own):** do not publish the port to the
  public internet. Instead put the node and miners on a private network / VPN
  (e.g. WireGuard, Tailscale, a cloud VPC/private subnet) and let miners reach
  the node over that private link.
- **If you must use a host firewall allow-list**, restrict the miner UDP port to
  the specific source IPs of your miner machines only, and deny it from
  everywhere else. Cloud users: keep it out of any `0.0.0.0/0` security-group
  rule.
- **Only `--port` (30333, P2P) is meant to be publicly reachable.** The miner
  port, RPC port (`9944`), and Prometheus port (`9616`) should all stay private
  or firewalled to trusted sources.

## Monitoring Your Node

### Check Node Status

**View Logs**
```bash
# Real-time logs
tail -f ~/.local/share/quantus-node/chains/planck/network/quantus-node.log

# Or run with verbose logging
RUST_LOG=info quantus-node [options]
```

**Prometheus Metrics**
Visit `http://localhost:9616/metrics` to view detailed node metrics.

**RPC Endpoint**
Use the RPC endpoint at `http://localhost:9944` to query blockchain state:

```bash
# Check latest block
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"chain_getBlock","params":[]}' \
  http://localhost:9944
```

### Check Mining Rewards

**View Balance at Your Wormhole Address**
```bash
# Replace YOUR_WORMHOLE_ADDRESS with your wormhole address from key generation
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"faucet_getAccountInfo","params":["YOUR_WORMHOLE_ADDRESS"]}' \
  http://localhost:9944
```

**Find Your Wormhole Address**
- From key generation: Use the `Address` field from `./quantus-node key quantus --scheme wormhole`
- From node logs: Check startup logs for "Mining rewards will be sent to wormhole address"

## Testnet Information

- **Chain**: Planck network
- **Consensus**: Quantum Proof of Work (QPoW)
- **Block Time**: ~6 seconds target
- **Network Explorer**: Coming soon
- **Faucet**: See Telegram

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Use different ports
quantus-node --port 30334 --prometheus-port 9617 [other options]
```

**Database Corruption**
```bash
# Purge and resync
quantus-node purge-chain --chain planck
```

**Mining Not Working**
1. Check that `--validator` flag is present
2. Verify your preimage from `inner_hash` field in key generation
3. Ensure node is synchronized (check logs for "Imported #XXXX")

**Wormhole Address Issues**
1. **Can't find rewards**: Check the `Address` field from your key generation
2. **Invalid preimage**: Use the exact `inner_hash` value from key generation  
3. **Wrong address**: Rewards go to the wormhole address, not the preimage

**Connection Issues**
1. Check firewall settings (allow port 30333)
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try different bootnodes if connectivity problems persist

## Mining Economics

### Wormhole Address Rewards System

- **Automatic Wormhole Addresses**: All mining rewards go to your wormhole address
- **Privacy by Design**: Your reward address is derived from your preimage
- **Block Rewards**: Earned by successfully mining blocks  
- **Transaction Fees**: Collected from transactions in mined blocks
- **Network Incentives**: Additional rewards for network participation

### Expected Performance

Mining performance depends on:
- CPU performance (cores and clock speed)
- Network latency to other nodes
- Node synchronization status
- Competition from other miners

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management

- **Backup Your Keys**: Securely store your wormhole key pair from key generation
- **Backup Node Keys**: Store copies of your node identity keys safely  
- **Secure Storage**: Keep preimages and private keys in encrypted storage

### Node Security

- **Firewall**: Only expose the P2P port (`30333`) to the public internet. Keep
  everything else private:
  - **Miner port** (`--miner-listen-port`, e.g. `9833/UDP`): private control
    channel protected by a shared auth token — still never expose it publicly.
    Use loopback for local miners, or a private network / VPN (or a source-IP-
    restricted firewall rule) for remote miners. See
    [Do NOT expose the miner port to the public internet](#️-do-not-expose-the-miner-port-to-the-public-internet).
  - **RPC port** (`9944`) and **Prometheus port** (`9616`): expose only to hosts
    that need them.
- **Updates**: Keep your node binary updated
- **Monitoring**: Watch for unusual network activity or performance

### Testnet Disclaimer

This is testnet software for testing purposes only:
- Tokens have no monetary value
- Network may be reset periodically
- Expect bugs and breaking changes
- Do not use for production workloads

## Next Steps

1. **Join the Community**: Connect with other miners and developers
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track your mining efficiency and rewards at your wormhole address
3. **Experiment**: Try different configurations and optimizations  
4. **Contribute**: Help improve the network by reporting issues and feedback

Happy mining! 🚀

# External Miner Protocol Specification

This section defines the QUIC-based protocol for communication between the Quantus Network node and external miner services. **This is technical documentation for developers building custom miner implementations.**

## Overview

The node delegates the mining task (finding a valid nonce) to external miner services over persistent QUIC connections. The node provides the necessary parameters (header hash, difficulty) and each external miner independently searches for a valid nonce according to the PoW rules defined in the `qpow-math` crate (using Poseidon2 hash function). Miners push results back when found.

### Key Benefits of QUIC

- **Lower latency**: Results are pushed immediately when found (no polling)
- **Connection resilience**: Built-in connection migration and recovery
- **Multiplexed streams**: Multiple operations on single connection
- **Built-in TLS**: Encrypted by default

## Architecture

### Connection Model

```
                           ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                           │            Node                 │
                           │   (QUIC Server on port 9833)    │
                           │                                 │
┌──────────┐               │  Broadcasts: NewJob             │
│  Miner 1 │ ──connect───► │  Receives: JobResult            │
└──────────┘               │                                 │
                           │  Supports multiple miners       │
┌──────────┐               │  First valid result wins        │
│  Miner 2 │ ──connect───► │                                 │
└──────────┘               └─────────────────────────────────┘
                           
┌──────────┐                         
│  Miner 3 │ ──connect───►           
└──────────┘                         
```

- **Node** acts as the QUIC server, listening on port 9833 (default)
- **Miners** act as QUIC clients, connecting to the node
- Single bidirectional stream per miner connection
- Connection persists across multiple mining jobs
- Multiple miners can connect simultaneously
- **Miners must send QUIC keep-alives** (e.g. every 5–15 seconds). The node
  sends no keep-alives and enforces a 60-second idle timeout; job traffic is
  event-driven, so on a quiet or high-difficulty chain a mining round can
  easily exceed 60 seconds with no packets. A miner without client keep-alives
  is silently disconnected mid-job and loses its seal. (The bundled
  `quantus-miner` sends keep-alives every 5 seconds.)

### Multi-Miner Operation

When multiple miners are connected:
1. Node broadcasts the same `NewJob` to all connected miners
2. Each miner independently selects a random starting nonce
3. First miner to find a valid solution sends `JobResult`
4. Node uses the first valid result, ignores subsequent results for same job
5. New job broadcast implicitly cancels work on all miners

### Message Types

The protocol uses **three message types**:

| Direction | Message | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Miner → Node | `Ready { token }` | Sent immediately after connecting to establish the stream and authenticate |
| Node → Miner | `NewJob` | Submit a mining job (implicitly cancels any previous job) |
| Miner → Node | `JobResult` | Mining result (completed, failed, or cancelled) |

### Wire Format

Messages are length-prefixed JSON:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Length (4 bytes)│ JSON payload (MinerMessage)     │
│ big-endian u32  │                                 │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Maximum message size: 1 KB (`MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` in `quantus-miner-api`)

## Data Types

See the `quantus-miner-api` crate for the canonical Rust definitions.

### MinerMessage (Enum)

```rust
pub enum MinerMessage {
    Ready { token: String },    // Miner → Node: establish stream + auth
    NewJob(MiningRequest),      // Node → Miner: submit job
    JobResult(MiningResult),    // Miner → Node: return result
}
```

The `token` must match the node's miner auth token (default file:
`<base-path>/chains/<chain>/miner-auth-token`, override with
`--miner-auth-token-file`). Connections that send a missing or wrong token are
closed before the peer is registered as a miner.

### MiningRequest

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `job_id` | String | Unique identifier (UUID recommended) |
| `mining_hash` | String | Header hash (64 hex chars, no 0x prefix) |
| `difficulty` | String | Difficulty (U512 as decimal string) |

Note: Nonce range is not specified - each miner independently selects a random starting point.

### MiningResult

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | ApiResponseStatus | Result status (see below) |
| `job_id` | String | Job identifier |
| `nonce` | Option<String> | Winning nonce (U512 hex, no 0x prefix) |
| `work` | Option<String> | Winning nonce as bytes (128 hex chars) |
| `hash_count` | u64 | Number of nonces checked |
| `elapsed_time` | f64 | Time spent mining (seconds) |
| `miner_id` | Option<u64> | Miner ID (set by node, not miner) |

### ApiResponseStatus (Enum)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `completed` | Valid nonce found |
| `failed` | Nonce range exhausted without finding solution |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled (new job received) |
| `running` | Job still in progress (not typically sent) |

  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "def", ... } ─────────│
  │                                            │
```

### Job Cancellation (Implicit)

When a new block arrives before the miner finds a solution, the node simply sends a new `NewJob`. The miner automatically cancels the previous job:

```
Miner                                        Node
  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "abc", ... } ─────────│
  │                                            │
  │     (mining "abc")                         │
  │                                            │
  │     (new block arrives at node!)           │
  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "def", ... } ─────────│
  │                                            │
  │     (cancels "abc", starts "def")          │
  │                                            │
  │──── JobResult { job_id: "def", ... } ─────►│
```

### Miner Connect During Active Job

When a miner connects while a job is active, it immediately receives the current job:

```
Miner (new)                                  Node
  │                                            │ (already mining job "abc")
  │──── QUIC Connect ─────────────────────────►│
  │◄─── Connection Established ────────────────│
  │                                            │
  │──── Ready { token } ──────────────────────►│ (establish stream + auth)
  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "abc", ... } ─────────│ (current job sent immediately)
  │                                            │
  │     (joins mining effort)                  │
```

### Stale Result Handling

If a result arrives for an old job, the node discards it:

```
Miner                                        Node
  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "abc", ... } ─────────│
  │                                            │
  │◄─── NewJob { job_id: "def", ... } ─────────│ (almost simultaneous)
  │                                            │
  │──── JobResult { job_id: "abc", ... } ─────►│ (stale, node ignores)
  │                                            │
  │──── JobResult { job_id: "def", ... } ─────►│ (current, node uses)
```

## Configuration

### Node

```bash
# Listen for external miner connections on port 9833
# Auth token + TLS cert/fingerprint default under <base-path>/chains/<chain>/
# (created on first run; token is not logged — read miner-auth-token;
#  fingerprint is logged; override auth path with --miner-auth-token-file)
quantus-node --miner-listen-port 9833
```

### Miner

```bash
# Connect with token (from miner-auth-token file) + TLS cert pin (from logs / file)
quantus-miner serve \
  --node-addr 127.0.0.1:9833 \
  --auth-token-file <BASE_PATH>/chains/<CHAIN>/miner-auth-token \
  --tls-cert-sha256-file <BASE_PATH>/chains/<CHAIN>/miner-tls-cert-sha256
```

## TLS Configuration

The node persists a self-signed TLS certificate for the miner QUIC server under
`<base-path>/chains/<chain>/` (`miner-tls-cert.der`, `miner-tls-key.der`) and
writes the cert's SHA-256 fingerprint to `miner-tls-cert-sha256`. Miners must
pin that fingerprint (`--tls-cert-sha256` / `--tls-cert-sha256-file`). The node
does **not** require client certificates; application-level auth is the shared
token in `Ready { token }`. Keep the miner port off the public internet (see
[Do NOT expose the miner port to the public internet](#️-do-not-expose-the-miner-port-to-the-public-internet)).
For production deployments, consider:

1. **Network isolation (required)**: Run node and miners on a private network /
   VPN, or restrict the miner port with a source-IP firewall allow-list. Do not
   publish it to `0.0.0.0/0`.
2. **Certificate pinning (required)**: Pass the node's `miner-tls-cert-sha256`
   value to every miner.
3. **Proper CA** (optional later): Use certificates signed by a trusted CA

## Error Handling

### Connection Loss

The miner automatically reconnects with exponential backoff:
- Initial delay: 1 second
- Maximum delay: 30 seconds

The node continues operating with remaining connected miners.

### Validation Errors

If the miner receives an invalid `MiningRequest`, it sends a `JobResult` with status `failed`.

## Implementation Notes

- All hex values should be sent **without** the `0x` prefix
- The miner implements validation logic from `qpow_math::is_valid_nonce`
- The node uses the `work` field from `MiningResult` to construct `QPoWSeal`
- ALPN protocol identifier: `quantus-miner/2` (versioned with the wire
  protocol; a mismatched miner fails at the TLS handshake with "no application
  protocol" rather than an auth error)
- Each miner independently generates a random nonce starting point using cryptographically secure randomness
- With a 512-bit nonce space, collision between miners is statistically impossible

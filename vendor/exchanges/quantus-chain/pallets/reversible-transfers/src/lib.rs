//! # Reversibility Core Pallet
//!
//! Provides the core logic for scheduling and cancelling reversible transactions.
//! It manages the state of accounts opting into reversibility and the pending
//! transactions associated with them. Transaction interception is handled
//! separately via a `SignedExtension`.
//!
//! ## Volume Fee for High-Security Accounts
//!
//! When high-security accounts reverse transactions, a configurable volume fee
//! (expressed as a Permill) is deducted from the transaction amount and burned.
//! Regular accounts do not incur any fees when reversing transactions.

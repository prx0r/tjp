//! 4-ary Poseidon Merkle tree implementation.
//!
//! This module provides the core tree operations:
//! - Leaf hashing (8 felts, injective for ≤32-bit values)
//! - Node hashing (16 felts, 8 bytes/felt compact encoding)
//! - Batched (once-per-block) folding of appended leaves into the tree
//! - Proof generation and verification
//! - Tree growth when capacity is exceeded

//! # ZK Tree Pallet
//!
//! A 4-ary Poseidon Merkle tree for storing ZK transfer proofs.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet provides a separate Merkle tree structure optimized for ZK circuits:
//! - 4-ary tree (4 children per node) for optimal ZK circuit efficiency
//! - Leaves hashed as 8 field elements (injective: values are ≤32 bits)
//! - Internal nodes hashed as 16 field elements (8 bytes/felt compact encoding)
//! - Inserts only append; the root is recomputed once per block in `on_finalize`, folding all of
//!   the block's leaves in a single bottom-up pass
//! - Tree root published in block header for ZK verification
//!
//! ## Tree Structure
//!
//! ```text
//!                     [Root]                    Level 2
//!                    /  |  \  \
//!              [N0] [N1] [N2] [N3]              Level 1  
//!             /|||\  ...
//!          [L0-L3]  ...                         Level 0 (leaves)
//! ```
//!
//! Leaf data: (to_account, transfer_count, asset_id, amount)
//! Leaf hash: poseidon(8 felts from leaf encoding)
//! Node hash: poseidon(sorted children concatenated → 16 felts)

/// A tree of depth 32 can hold 4^32 leaves.
///
/// NOTE (known, accepted limitation): this is intentionally *larger* than the depth the
/// wormhole circuits accept. The circuits fix `MAX_DEPTH = 16` (`qp-zk-circuits-common`,
/// `zk_merkle.rs`) because every leaf proof pays the proving cost of a full
/// `MAX_DEPTH`-level Merkle path regardless of the tree's current depth — keeping it at
/// 16 keeps proving fast for everyone. If the tree ever grows past depth 16
/// (4^16 ≈ 4.3 billion leaves), Merkle proofs gain a 17th sibling level and the prover
/// and verifier reject them, so wormhole proof generation halts until a circuit update
/// raises `MAX_DEPTH` and a runtime upgrade embeds the regenerated verifiers.
///
/// This is a deliberate "fix it when we get close" trade-off, not an oversight:
/// - Timeline: at one leaf per block (the mining-reward floor, 12s blocks) depth 16 lasts ~1,600
///   years; at a sustained 10 transfers/sec chain-wide it lasts ~13 years; even permanently
///   saturated blocks (~50 tps) give ~2.5 years. Each +1 of circuit depth quadruples capacity.
/// - Observability: `LeafCount` is public storage, so exhaustion is visible years in advance; alert
///   well before 4^16 leaves.
/// - The update itself: bump `MAX_DEPTH` in `qp-zk-circuits-common`, release the circuit crates,
///   let `pallets/wormhole/build.rs` regenerate the embedded verifier binaries, regenerate proof
///   fixtures, re-benchmark, and ship a runtime upgrade — days of engineering inside a normal
///   release cycle. Old proofs are invalidated by the circuit change; nullifier state is

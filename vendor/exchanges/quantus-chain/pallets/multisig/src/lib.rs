//! # Quantus Multisig Pallet
//!
//! This pallet provides multisignature functionality for managing shared accounts
//! that require multiple approvals before executing transactions.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Create multisig addresses with deterministic generation (signers + threshold + user-provided
//!   nonce)
//! - Propose transactions for multisig approval
//! - Approve proposed transactions (approvers resubmit the inner call, which must match the stored
//!   proposal payload — binding each approval signature to the actual call)
//! - Execute transactions once threshold is reached (automatic)
//! - Cleanup of expired proposals via claim_deposits() and remove_expired()
//! - Per-signer proposal limits for filibuster protection
//!
//! ## Design Notes
//!
//! Multisigs are permanent once created. There is no dissolution mechanism by design:
//! - Avoids complexity around native/non-native asset handling during dissolution
//! - Prevents griefing attacks (e.g., sending dust to block dissolution)
//! - Users who want to "close" a multisig simply stop using it
//!
//! ## Data Structures
//!
//! - **MultisigData**: Contains signers, threshold, proposal counter, and per-signer tracking
//! - **ProposalData**: Contains transaction data, proposer, expiry, approvals, deposit, and status

//! # Utility Pallet
//! A stateless pallet with helpers for dispatch management which does no re-authentication.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet exposes a single dispatchable: atomic batch dispatch. Any origin except `None`
//! can execute multiple calls in one extrinsic; if any child fails, the whole transaction
//! rolls back. This is useful for combining several payouts or scheduled transfers under a
//! single signature.
//!
//! Other FRAME utility combinators (`batch`, `force_batch`, `if_else`, `as_derivative`,
//! `dispatch_as`, `with_weight`) are intentionally omitted to keep the runtime call surface
//! small. Call index 2 is preserved so existing `batch_all` encodings keep decoding.
//!
//! Since proxy filters are respected in all dispatches of this pallet, it should never need to
//! be filtered by any proxy.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * `batch_all` - Dispatch multiple calls from the sender's origin, atomically.

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.

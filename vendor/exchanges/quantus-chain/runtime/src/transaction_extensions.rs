/// Transaction extension that records transfer proofs in the wormhole pallet
///
/// This extension uses an EVENT-BASED approach to detect transfers:
/// - After successful execution, scans for `Transfer`, `Minted`, `TransferOnHold` and
///   `ReserveRepatriated` events
/// - Records proofs for any transfers that were sent TO a wormhole account
/// - Automatically catches ALL transfers dispatched inside a transaction, regardless of how they're
///   initiated:
///   - Direct transfers (transfer, transfer_keep_alive, transfer_all, etc.)
///   - Batch transfers (utility.batch_all)
///   - Multisig transfers (multisig.execute)
///   - Held-fund seizures/recoveries (reversible_transfers.cancel / recover_funds, which move value
///     with `transfer_on_hold` instead of a free-balance transfer). Owner cancel of a one-time
///     schedule uses `release` instead — hold → free on the same account, not a credit — so it
///     emits no `TransferOnHold` and records no leaf.
///   - Future call-based mechanisms automatically covered, since wrapper calls emit their inner
///     events within the same extrinsic's event range
///
/// COVERAGE BOUNDARY: transaction extensions only run for transactions, so this scan
/// never sees events emitted from hooks (`on_initialize` / `on_finalize`). Every
/// hook-context credit therefore needs — and has — an explicit
/// `TransferProofRecorder::record_transfer_proof` call instead:
///   - reversible-transfers' scheduled execution records its transfer in `do_execute_transfer`
///     (skipped when `from == to`, which moves no value);
///   - mining rewards record theirs in `on_finalize` (`pallet_mining_rewards`). Sub-quantum
///     remainder stays in `CollectedFees` for the next miner (no leaf). Those credits use
///     `mint_into`, which *does* emit `Balances::Minted` (the same event this scanner records);
///     they are safe from double-recording only because distribution runs in `on_finalize`, outside
///     every extrinsic's scan window. Moving that distribution into `on_initialize` or a signed
///     path without also suppressing the scan (or the explicit record) would inflate wormhole exit
///     capacity.
///
/// The one remaining hook-context path is a governance-enacted call: referenda enactment
/// dispatches the approved call via the scheduler in `on_initialize`, so its events are
/// not scanned and no leaf is recorded. This is a
/// known, accepted gap rather than an oversight: the scheduler's `ScheduleOrigin` is
/// Root, the tech-referenda track only accepts Root proposal origins, and sudo is
/// removed — so only Root can reach it, and Root can already forge or delete leaves
/// outright (`set_storage`, runtime upgrades), so there is no invariant left to defend
/// against it. The miss is conservative (the credit exists but gains no ZK-spendable
/// leaf; no unbacked exit capacity is created) and repairable (governance can re-issue
/// the credit as an ordinary signed transfer if a leaf is wanted).

		//    `remark_with_event`), and the decode cost is per record AND per byte present at scan
		//    time — see `event_scan_weight`.
		//
		// 2. Recording shortfall: a defense-in-depth backstop for transfer events on any path the
		//    static `count_transfers` matcher misses. No such path is currently known — every
		//    dispatch wrapper (multisig `execute` included) carries its inner call in the submitted
		//    extrinsic, and `recover_funds` is charged its worst case — but should the
		//    proof-recording work above exceed the weight reserved by `weight()`, the flat
		//    per-transfer price times the count difference covers it.
		//
		// "Post-hoc and not fee-charged" is a deliberate, accepted trade-off, not an
		// oversight (security review 2026-08):
		//
		// - It cannot be fee-charged: the scan cost depends on how many events EARLIER transactions
		//   in the same block emitted, unknowable when the fee is computed.
		//   `TransactionExtension::weight()` is static by design, and post-dispatch fee correction
		//   only refunds downward — `actual_weight` is capped at the pre-charged weight. The only
		//   alternative, reserving a worst-case whole-block scan in every transaction upfront,
		//   would collapse throughput to insure against microseconds of work.
		//
		// - Block capacity stays sound: `register_extra_weight_unchecked` accrues into
		//   `BlockWeight` before the NEXT transaction's `CheckWeight` admission, so later
		//   transactions are refused once the block fills. The worst case is a bounded
		//   one-transaction overshoot at the block boundary (the same accepted pattern FRAME uses
		//   for `on_initialize` overruns).
		//
		// - The economics don't invert: emitting events is fully fee-charged through the emitting
		//   calls' benchmarked weights, and the uncharged decode here is ~1µs/record + ~10ns/byte —
		//   orders of magnitude below what the attacker pays to produce those events.

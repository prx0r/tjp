// Transaction Fee Structure
// ============================================================================
//
// This is a solo Proof of Work chain (not a parachain), so Proof of Validity (PoV)
// size limits do not apply - we don't submit proofs to any relay chain.
//
// Fee Structure:
// - **Compute (ref_time):** 1 balance unit per unit of ref_time
//   - 1 second of compute ≈ 1 UNIT (since WEIGHT_REF_TIME_PER_SECOND = 10^12)
//   - Uses `ScaledIdentityFee`: direct 1:1 mapping × `FEE_SCALE`
//
// - **Extrinsic Length:** 1 UNIT per megabyte (LENGTH_FEE_MULTIPLIER = 10^6)
//   - This brings storage/bandwidth costs in line with compute costs
//   - A 5 MB block (max size) costs ~5 UNIT in length fees
//   - A typical 500-byte transfer costs ~0.0005 UNIT in length fees
//   - Uses `LengthToFeeMultiplier` with 10^6 coefficient
//
// - **Proof Size:** Not enforced or charged
//   - Block weight limit uses u64::MAX for proof_size component
//   - WeightToFee only considers ref_time, not proof_size
//
// Fee Destination:
// - 100% of transaction fees go to the block miner
// - Block rewards go 100% to the miner (quantized to the wormhole leaf quantum; any sub-quantum
//   remainder stays in CollectedFees for the next miner)
//
// Spam Prevention:
// - Existential deposit: 0.001 UNIT
// - Various pallet-specific deposits (multisig, governance, etc.)
// - Miners can reject transactions below their minimum fee threshold
//
// ============================================================================
// Proof Size Design Rationale
// ============================================================================
//
// **Why proof_size is set to u64::MAX and not priced:**
//
// In Substrate's two-dimensional weight system, `proof_size` represents the amount of
// state witness data required for stateless validation. This is critical for parachains
// where validators must re-execute blocks using only the PoV (Proof of Validity) blob,
// which has strict size limits imposed by the relay chain.
//
// For this solo PoW chain, proof_size constraints are intentionally disabled because:
//
// 1. **No relay chain constraints:** Unlike parachains, solo chains have no external entity
//    imposing PoV size limits. Validators have full state access.
//
// 2. **Full nodes validate blocks:** All validators maintain complete state, so they don't need
//    witnesses to re-execute transactions.
//
// 3. **ref_time provides sufficient protection:** Compute-bound benchmarking (ref_time) naturally
//    correlates with state access patterns. Heavy state reads/writes increase ref_time, providing
//    indirect protection against state-heavy transactions.
//
// 4. **Block length limits storage abuse:** The 5 MB block size limit caps the amount of data that
//    can be included per block, preventing bandwidth-based attacks.
//
// **When to revisit this decision:**
//
// This design should be reconsidered if the chain adopts features where proof/witness
// size becomes a meaningful resource constraint:
//
// - **Light client support:** Light clients verify blocks using state proofs. Large witnesses
//   increase sync times and bandwidth requirements for light clients.
//
// - **Cross-chain bridges:** Bridge protocols often require merkle proofs of state. Unbounded proof
//   sizes could make bridge operations expensive or impractical.
//
// - **Stateless validation:** If the chain moves toward stateless block validation (validators
//   don't keep full state), witness size becomes a critical resource.
//
// - **ZK proof generation:** If state proofs are used as inputs to ZK circuits, proof size directly
//   impacts prover time and memory requirements.
//
// To enable proof_size enforcement in the future:
// 1. Set a concrete proof_size limit in RuntimeBlockWeights (instead of u64::MAX)
// 2. Update WeightToFee to price both ref_time and proof_size dimensions
// 3. Ensure all pallet benchmarks accurately measure proof_size

///
/// Used by:
/// - Multisig pallet: validates calls in `propose()` extrinsic
/// - Transaction extensions: validates calls for high-security EOAs
///
/// Whitelist includes only delayed, reversible operations:
/// - `schedule_transfer`: delayed native transfer; dest must be `MultiAddress::Id` so a stolen key
///   cannot pad `MultiAddress::Raw` and exfiltrate via the length fee
/// - `cancel`: Cancel pending delayed transfer
/// - `recover_funds`: Guardian-initiated recovery
/// - `Utility::batch_all`: a flat, non-empty batch of at most [`MaxHighSecurityBatchLen`] leaf
///   calls, each of which must itself be whitelisted. Nested `batch_all` is rejected so a packed
///   wrapper cannot inflate the inclusion fee. The pallet still re-checks each child at dispatch so
///   a same-tx enrollment cannot smuggle a later drain.
///
/// `Vesting::claim` is not listed: it is permissionless, so a third party can
/// claim on behalf of a high-security beneficiary. The HS signer does not need
/// it, and leaving it on the list was only another no-op fee path.
///
/// The tip is not part of `RuntimeCall`. High-security signers are forced to a
/// zero tip by `transaction_extensions::HighSecurityFungibleAdapter` inside
/// `OnChargeTransaction`, which every fee path goes through.
/// Signed extrinsics from a high-security account are also capped at 16 per
/// rolling day by `ReversibleTransactionExtension` (see `HighSecurityTxQuota`),
/// and at [`MAX_HIGH_SECURITY_EXTRINSIC_LEN`] encoded bytes so the length fee
/// cannot be inflated through any variable-length field.
///
/// The quota keys on the outer signer, so a *single-key* high-security
/// guardian shares it with its own traffic and can be quota-locked out of
/// `cancel`/`recover_funds` for up to a day. Documented limitation: an
/// exemption for live guardian interventions would be farmable (enrollment
/// needs no guardian consent), and the recommended multisig guardian is

/// applies to it, even when the multisig is itself high-security.
